Multicellular Transcriptional Landscape of Heart Failure

Overview


Key Features

    Multicellular Gene Expression Mapping: Uniting single-cell and bulk transcriptomics to describe coordinated gene expression changes during HF.
    Cohort-Wide Analysis: Data from over 1,500 patients, accounting for clinical and technical heterogeneity.
    Consensus Disease Programs: Identification of convergent molecular pathways involved in HF, enabling more consistent interpretation of gene expression data across cohorts.
    Exploratory Platform: Our work is presented in a user-friendly platform for further exploration of the underlying molecular biology of heart failure.

Goals

    To provide a systematic integration of transcriptomic datasets for understanding heart failure at a multicellular level.
    To offer reproducible insights into gene regulation and expression patterns across a large number of patients.
    To support the development of new hypotheses and potential therapeutic targets for heart failure.

How to Explore the Data

We provide access to the dataset, scripts, and visual tools to explore the molecular profiles of HF. Visit our [documentation](link to documentation) for detailed instructions on accessing and navigating the platform.
