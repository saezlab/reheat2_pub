# Multicellular Transcriptional Landscape of Heart Failure
An integrative meta-analysis of the cardiac transcriptomie changes in heart failure. 

### Overview
We analyzed cardiac transcriptome changes captured in bulk and single nuc data from heart failure patients and performed an integrative analysis to identify shared multicellular programs that characterize the failing heart. 
In particular we decomposed disease signatures to study the contribtution of cell type composition changes. 


### Key Features
HF patient map. Meta-analysis of single nuc data to identify shared multicellular programs
Blueprint of HF. The identificiation of a network of cell-type dependencies behind the multicellular program.
Integrative analysis with bulk. We map multicellular programs to bulk. 
Cohort-Wide Analysis: Data from over 1,500 patients, accounting for clinical and technical heterogeneity.
Consensus Disease Programs: Identification of convergent molecular pathways involved in HF, enabling more consistent interpretation of gene expression data across cohorts.
Exploratory Platform: Our work is presented in a user-friendly platform for further exploration of the underlying molecular biology of heart failure.


### How to Explore the Data
We provide a user friendly access to a gene query of the the multicellular program 1 associated with heart failure in [shiny.io/](https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/reheat2/). All processed data and models can be accessed in zenodo (DOI:)
